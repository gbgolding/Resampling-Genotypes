# Resampling-Genotypes

The file asexual8.c is a plain C code file used to generate the asexual_X.ans files where X is the population size chosen for the simulation.

The file sexual8.c is a plain C code file used to generate the sexual_X.ans files.  The sexual_1000_30.ans file is 30 runs with a population size of 1000.  The file is numerically sorted by the first column to give the file sex_avg_1000. The AWK script is then used to calculate the average of the 30 runs this is then ploted using pgfplots.
