# Resampling-Genotypes

The file asexual8.c is a plain C code file used to generate the asexual_X.ans files where X is the population size chosen for the simulation.

The file sexual8.c is a plain C code file used to generate the sexual_X.ans files.  The sexual_1000_30.ans file is 30 runs with a population size of 1000.  The AWK script is used to calculate the average of the 30 runs and puts it's output into sex_avg_1000.  This file is then ploted using pgfplots.
